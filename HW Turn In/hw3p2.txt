In my experience, the memory of my three methods use up the same amount, taking up the same number of memory addresses.

Based on the answers found in the back of the book, I could have condensed my code for the AOC and SOJ methods, therefore using less memory. If I had used a single loop rather than two loops for these methods, there would be less memory addresses being used, using less memory overall.

SOJ would use the least amount of memory, followed by higher memory usage with the AOC method, and having no special looping instructions would use the most memory.
